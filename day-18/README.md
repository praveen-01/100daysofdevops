# day-18: Configure LAMP server
---

# Task
xFusionCorp Industries is planning to host a WordPress website on their infra in Stratos Datacenter. They have already done infrastructure configurationâ€”for example, on the storage server they already have a shared directory /vaw/www/html that is mounted on each app host under /var/www/html directory. Please perform the following steps to accomplish the task:
a. Install httpd, php and its dependencies on all app hosts.
b. Apache should serve on port 5003 within the apps.
c. Install/Configure MariaDB server on DB Server.
d. Create a database named kodekloud_db1 and create a database user named kodekloud_pop identified as password ksH85UJjhb. Further make sure this newly created user is able to perform all operation on the database you created.
e. Finally you should be able to access the website on LBR link, by clicking on the App button on the top bar. You should see a message like App is able to connect to the database using user kodekloud_pop

- install httpd and php
```
yum install -y httpd php
sudo yum install -y php-mysqlnd php-pdo php-gd php-xml php-mbstring
```
- go to /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf and update the Listen port from 80 to 5003
- enable and start the systemd service on all app hosts
- try the app link at the top to make sure the service is up and running we should see `App is not able to connect to db` but we should see that message if not we have to check if httpd service is up and running on all 3 app servers and is on port mentioned in the task(could be diffferent port so please check the task for httpd port)
- On db host install mariadb server
```
yum install mariadb-server
```
- start the service
```
[root@stdb01 ~]# systemctl start mariadb.service
```
- login into mariadb as root
```
[root@stdb01 ~]# mysql -u root

```
- now try the app link again and it should show `App is able to connect to the database using user kodekloud_pop` if yes then we are good with the task, if not make sure the db server is up and running and we can login to the `kodekloud_pop` using user we created earlier
